      <h1>My JS Accelerated Course Experience</h1>
      <br>
      <h3>I, like a lot of other students looking into the WDI, am brand new to the world of code and coding, <br>so I decided to take the JS Accelerated course to get my feet wet.</h3>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h2>This is what I learned...</h2>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="whatIKnow">

    <h3>Three things that I feel I have a decent grasp of:</h3>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Growth vs Fixed mindset</li>
      <img src="http://www.lynnkjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Growth-or-Fixed-Mindset.png" alt="Growth vs Fixed Mindset" height="200">
      <li>The three-step learning process:</li>
      <ol>
        <li>Set the stage</li>
        <ul>
          <li>clear the stage - eliminate distractions</li>
          <li>clarify the WHAT and the WHY - what are we doing and why are we doing it?</li>
          <li>prioritize process over product - a sound process will lead to a sound product. don't ignore the details</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Play</li>
        <ul>
          <li>wrestle with it - it won't always be perfect out the gate, keep trying</li>
          <li>take risks - no risks = no growth</li>
          <li>have fun - pretty self-explanatory!</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Reflect</li>
        <ul>
          <li>self-assess - review what is going well and what needs improving</li>
          <li>ask new questions - if you don't know something or need help, ask someone. use your resources</li>
          <li>repeat</li>
        </ul>
      </ol>
      <li>HTML</li>
      <ul>
        <li>in no way do I feel like an expert in html, but I spent some time working through the Code Academy html lessons.<br> That, coupled with my experience in the JS Accelerated course and I feel comforable at least writing this page!</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <br>
  </div>
  <div class="whatINeedToKnow">

    <h3>Three things I definitely hope to get better at with more experience:</h3>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Functions</li>
      <ul>
        <li>when in class, after warming up and walking through functions I felt good about them, but as far as on my own, I still struggle</li>
      </ul>
      <li>git requests</li>
      <ul>
        <li>again, in class it clicked, but outside of class I would be on the right track but not 100% on</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Lingo</li>
      <ul>
        <li>not having a background in computers/coding I look forward to the immersive, working with the lingo every day until it's second nature</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
